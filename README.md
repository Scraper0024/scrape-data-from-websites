## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping involves the use of software or scripts to collect and process information from websites. Unlike manual data collection, web scraping automates the extraction process, making it more efficient and scalable. The primary goal is to gather actionable insights or large datasets for analysis, research, or integration into applications.

Web scraping plays a key role in providing data **for machine learning models**, further advancing the advancement of artificial intelligence technology. By automating the data collection process and expanding the data to collect information from a variety of sources, web scraping helps create powerful, accurate, and well-trained artificial intelligence models.

Web scraping is particularly useful if the public website you want to obtain data from does not have an API, or only provides limited access to web data!

In this case, traditional methods cannot meet the needs, and leveraging external web scraping services such as Scrapeless may be a strategic approach. **These services provide more efficient and scalable solutions**. In addition, for those who are looking for advanced features, tools such as Scrapeless's API and Scraping Browser provide comprehensive solutions, providing features such as handling blocking, automatic browser operations, session and cookie management, and efficient data extraction.

**And compared to other similar products, Scrapeless also provides cheaper prices while ensuring high stability. It relieves the cost burden for those companies with limited budgets but strong needs.**

## How Does Web Scraping Work?
Web scraping is the process of automating the collection of unstructured and structured data. It is also widely known as web data extraction or web data scraping.

Some of the major use cases for web scraping include [**price monitoring**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/google-flights-api), **price intelligence**, **news monitoring**, **lead generation**, and [**market research**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/amazon-product-scraper), among others.

Generally speaking, it is used by individuals and businesses who want to leverage publicly available web data to generate valuable insights and make smarter decisions.

### Web scraping manually
If you have ever copied and pasted information from a website, you performed the same function as any web scraping tool, except that you performed the data scraping process manually:
1. Identify the target website
2. Collect the URLs of the target pages
3. Make requests to those URLs to get the HTML of the page
4. Use locators to find information in the HTML
5. Save the data as a JSON or CSV file or other structured format

It seems to be enough for daily web scraping. Unfortunately, if you need to extract data on a large scale, [**you need to deal with quite a few challenges**](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/web-scraping-challenges).

For example, if the website layout changes, maintain data extraction tools and web crawlers, [manage proxies](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/proxies), execute javascript, or [bypass anti-bots](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/how-to-avoid-anti-bot). These are technical issues that consume internal resources.

At this time, we need to use more powerful automation tools - Web Scraper

### Web scraper
Unlike the tedious process of extracting data yourself, web scraping uses machine learning and intelligent automation to retrieve millions or even billions of extracted data points from the internet. 
1. Web scraping works by sending HTTP requests to a website and fetching its HTML content.
2. The script then parses the HTML structure to locate and extract specific data points using tags, attributes, or patterns.
3. Advanced methods can handle dynamic content rendered via JavaScript by simulating browser behavior using tools like Puppeteer or Selenium.

Whether you write a web scraper yourself or use a powerful web data extraction tool, you need to know more about the basics of web scraping or web data extraction!

## Differences between Web Scraping and Web Crawling
| Features | Web Scraping | Web Crawling |
| - | - | - |
| **Goal** | Extract specific data | Crawl web links and build content index |
| **Scope** | Focus on a small number of web pages and specific content | Crawl a large number of web pages |
| **Technical complexity** | Medium, mainly used for data analysis | High, need to manage link tracking and deduplication |
| **Common tools** | BeautifulSoup, Puppeteer, Scrapy | Scrapy, Apache Nutch, Selenium |
| **Main applications** | Data analysis, e-commerce price monitoring | Search engine indexing, SEO analysis |

### The web scraping
Web scraping is a focused process used to extract specific data from a web page and convert it into a structured format, such as CSV or JSON. The goal is to retrieve precise information, such as prices, reviews, or product details, for analysis or further use. Scrapers use tools like XPath, CSS selectors, or regex to locate and extract the desired data efficiently.

### The web crawling
Web crawling, often referred to as "spidering," is an automated process of browsing the internet to index and collect web pages by following links. Crawlers are typically used to build large datasets or indexes, like those for search engines. In some projects, web crawling is a preliminary step to gather URLs, which are then processed by a web scraper to extract specific data.
